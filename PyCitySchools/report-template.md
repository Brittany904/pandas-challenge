# Module 4 Written Report

    In this analysis, two datasets that contains the information on different school locations spending, student scores, and 
    district data have been combined together. The purpose of this was to make it more convienent to display trends in the schools 
    performance and provide assistance with future decisions. There have been numerous calculations done on the different date to 
    display the appropriate metrics in a Jupyter worksheet. 
    

    In the first display of information, it does show that there are 15 schools with a total of 39,170 students all with an
    overall passing percentage of about 65%. That percentage does combine the scores of the students testing scores. In another 
    display of the school's data, it does show a school such as Johnson High School has a greater amount of students at 4,761 and 
    a total school budget of $3,094,650.00. While the budget for the school is great, the overall passing score is 54%. This is 
    significantly/ less than Pena High school with 962 students, a budget of $585,858.00, and a passing score of 91%. That means 
    that a higher school budget does not necessarily equate to higher testing or passing scores of students. Pehaps it could be 
    due to the student to teacher ratio, or the breakdown of where the schools spend their money.
